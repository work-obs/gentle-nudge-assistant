2. Click "Get it now" 
3. Select your Jira site from the dropdown
4. Click "Install app" and authorize the installation
5. The app will appear in your "Apps" menu within a few minutes

The installation requires standard user permissions and doesn't need administrator approval in most organizations.

### Q: Do I need to be a Jira administrator to use this app?

**A:** No! Regular Jira users can install and use Gentle Nudge Assistant without administrator privileges. However, some advanced team features are only available to project administrators.

**Regular users can:**

### Q: How long does it take to start receiving notifications?

**A:** You'll typically receive your first gentle nudge within 24 hours of installation, but this depends on your ticket activity:

- **Immediate setup**: Configuration and welcome tour (5 minutes)
- **First analysis**: System analyzes your tickets (2-4 hours) 
- **First notification**: Based on your settings and ticket status (within 24 hours)
- **Optimization period**: System learns your preferences (1-2 weeks)

If you have stale tickets that meet your threshold, you might receive notifications sooner!

- **No long-term contracts**: Flexible pricing options

During the trial, you have access to all premium features to fully evaluate the app's value for your workflow.

## Notification Issues

### Q: Why am I not receiving any notifications?

**A:** Several factors might prevent notifications. Here's a systematic check:

**1. Settings Check:**
- Go to Settings > Notification Frequency
- Ensure it's not set to "Disabled" or "Minimal"
- Check that stale threshold is reasonable (5-7 days recommended)

**2. Quiet Hours Check:**
- Review your quiet hours settings
- Make sure you're checking during active hours
- Consider if weekend settings are too restrictive

**3. Project Filters:**
- Verify your project filters include projects where you have assigned tickets
- Check if you've accidentally excluded all your active projects
- Review issue type filters

**4. Ticket Status:**
- Confirm you have tickets that meet the stale criteria
- Check that tickets aren't resolved or in excluded states
- Verify you're actually assigned to the tickets

**Quick Fix**: Try the "Test Notification" feature in Settings to verify the system is working.

### Q: I'm getting too many notifications. How do I reduce them?

**A:** Here are effective strategies to reduce notification frequency:

**Immediate Solutions:**
- Switch to "Gentle" or "Minimal" notification frequency
- Increase your stale ticket threshold (from 5 to 7-10 days)
- Enable workload sensitivity to prevent overwhelming periods
- Set stricter quiet hours

**Fine-Tuning Options:**
- Filter out low-priority issues
- Exclude specific projects during busy periods
- Reduce deadline warning frequency
- Set daily notification limits (recommended: 3-5 max)

**Advanced Filtering:**
```yaml
Quick Reduction Settings:
- Notification Frequency: "Gentle"
- Stale Threshold: 7 days
- Max Daily: 3 notifications  
- Quiet Hours: 6 PM - 8 AM
- Weekend Quiet: Enabled
```

### Q: Can I pause notifications temporarily?

**A:** Yes! Several options for temporary pause:

**Quick Pause (24-48 hours):**
- Use "Snooze All" in notification settings
- Extend quiet hours temporarily
- Switch to "Minimal" frequency

**Extended Pause (vacation, crunch time):**
- Enable "Vacation Mode" in settings
- Set custom date ranges for extended quiet periods
- Configure "Do Not Disturb" with return date

**Project-Specific Pause:**
- Temporarily exclude specific projects
- Pause only certain notification types
- Keep critical deadline reminders active

The app remembers your original settings and makes it easy to resume normal operations.

### Q: Why don't I get notifications about certain tickets?

**A:** Notifications are filtered based on several intelligent criteria:

**Automatic Exclusions:**
- Tickets in "Done," "Closed," or "Resolved" status
- Issues with "on-hold" or "blocked" labels
- Tickets where you're not the assignee (unless configured otherwise)
- Issues updated recently by other team members
- Sub-tasks when parent ticket is active

**Your Filter Settings:**
- Project inclusion/exclusion rules
- Issue type filters
- Priority level thresholds
- Custom label rules

**Workload Intelligence:**
- System detects when you're overloaded and reduces non-critical notifications
- Recently active tickets get grace periods
- High-priority work takes precedence

**Check your filters** in Settings > Filtering to see exactly what's included or excluded.

## Configuration Questions

### Q: What's the difference between notification frequency levels?

**A:** Here's a detailed breakdown:

| Feature | Minimal | Gentle | Moderate | Custom |
|---------|---------|---------|----------|---------|
| **Stale Reminders** | Weekly | Every 3 days | Daily | Your choice |
| **Deadline Warnings** | 1 day before | 3, 1 days before | 7, 3, 1 days before | Configurable |
| **Max Daily Notifications** | 1 | 3 | 5 | Up to 10 |
| **Progress Updates** | Monthly | Weekly | Bi-weekly | Custom schedule |
| **Workload Sensitivity** | High | High | Moderate | Configurable |
| **Best For** | Very busy periods | Most users | Active collaborators | Power users |

**Recommendation**: Start with "Gentle" for 1-2 weeks, then adjust based on your experience.

### Q: How do I create custom message templates?

**A:** Custom messaging is available in the Advanced Settings:

**1. Access Template Editor:**

Your ticket {issueKey} - '{issueSummary}' 
hasn't been updated in {daysSinceUpdate} days. 
When you have a moment, it would appreciate some attention! âœ¨"
```

**4. Tone Guidelines:**
- Keep it positive and encouraging

### Q: How do escalation rules work?

**A:** Escalation rules help teams manage tickets that remain stale despite gentle nudges:

**Escalation Triggers:**

- Multiple dismissed notifications without action
- Approaching or missed critical deadlines
- High-priority tickets with extended inactivity

**Escalation Actions:**
```yaml
Example Escalation Rules:
  Level 1 (5 days stale):
    - Increase notification frequency
    - Switch to more direct tone
    
  Level 2 (10 days stale):
    - Notify project lead
    - Create follow-up task
    - Suggest reassignment options
    
  Level 3 (15+ days stale):
    - Create team discussion ticket
    - Schedule team review meeting
    - Consider ticket archiving or closure
```

**Escalation Best Practices:**
- Start with gentle internal escalation
- Focus on helping rather than pressuring
- Provide context and suggested solutions
- Maintain positive, supportive tone throughout
