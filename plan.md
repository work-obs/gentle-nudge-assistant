# Gentle Nudge Assistant - Jira Cloud Plugin Plan

## Overview

The Gentle Nudge Assistant is a Jira Cloud plugin built on Atlassian's Forge platform that provides friendly, context-aware reminders about stale tickets and approaching deadlines. The plugin emphasizes encouragement over nagging, creating a positive user experience that helps teams stay productive without feeling overwhelmed.

## Key Features

- **User-Controlled Preferences**: Individual users can customize notification frequency and timing

### Notification Types
1. **Gentle Stale Reminders**: "Your ticket [ISSUE-123] might benefit from a quick check-in ðŸŒŸ"
