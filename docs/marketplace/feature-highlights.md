## Feature Deep Dive

### Smart Notification Engine

#### Stale Ticket Detection Algorithm
```
Intelligence Factors:
‚îå‚îÄ Issue Priority (Critical > High > Medium > Low)
‚îú‚îÄ Days Since Last Update (Configurable threshold)
‚îú‚îÄ Current User Workload (Prevents overwhelming)
‚îú‚îÄ Project Context (Production > Development > Testing)
‚îú‚îÄ Issue Complexity (Story points, sub-tasks, dependencies)
‚îú‚îÄ Historical Patterns (User's typical response times)
‚îî‚îÄ Team Capacity (Shared workload considerations)

Decision Matrix:
High Priority + Recent Activity = Gentle reminder
High Priority + No Activity = Encouraging nudge
Low Priority + High Workload = Delayed reminder
Critical + Approaching Deadline = Respectful urgency
```

**Example Outcomes**:
- **Productive Period**: "You're on fire! üî• [DEV-123] would love some of that momentum when you're ready."
- **Busy Period**: "When you catch your breath, [DEV-456] has been patiently waiting for your expertise."
- **Critical Issue**: "I know you're juggling a lot, but [BUG-789] really needs your attention when possible. You've got this! üí™"

#### Deadline Awareness System
```
Timeline Strategy:
‚îå‚îÄ 14+ days: Optional early awareness
‚îú‚îÄ 7 days: Friendly heads-up
