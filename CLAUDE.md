This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the Gentle Nudge Assistant, a Jira Cloud plugin built on Atlassian's Forge platform that provides friendly, context-aware reminders about stale tickets and approaching deadlines. The plugin emphasizes encouragement over nagging, creating a positive user experience that helps teams stay productive without feeling overwhelmed.

## Development Commands

- Run unit tests: `npm run test:unit`
- Run integration tests: `npm run test:integration`
- Run E2E tests: `npm run test:e2e`
- Run performance tests: `npm run test:performance`
- Run accessibility tests: `npm run test:accessibility`
- Generate coverage report: `npm run test:coverage`

### Deployment

- Type check: `npm run typecheck`

## Architecture

### Core Architecture
- **Platform**: Atlassian Forge (serverless functions, event-driven architecture)
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript with Forge UI Kit components
- **Backend**: Forge functions with Jira Cloud REST API integration
- **Storage**: Forge key-value store for user preferences and tracking data
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library with comprehensive test suite

### Key Directories
- `src/notification-engine/` - Core notification logic and scheduling
- `src/analytics/` - Issue staleness detection and deadline monitoring
- `src/ui/` - React components, hooks, and utilities
- `src/api/` - Jira Cloud API integration
- `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `tests/` - Comprehensive testing suite
- `docs/` - User and developer documentation
- `deploy/` - Deployment scripts and configurations
- `marketplace/` - Marketplace submission assets

### Key Features
- **Smart Stale Ticket Detection**: Context-aware analysis with configurable thresholds
- **Gentle Deadline Reminders**: Encouraging notifications with positive tone
- **User Workload Awareness**: Prevents overwhelming users with too many notifications  
- **Accessibility-First Design**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with screen reader support
- **Performance Optimized**: Handles 10,000+ issues efficiently with smart caching
- **Enterprise Security**: GDPR compliant with comprehensive privacy controls

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Use TypeScript strict mode with comprehensive type definitions
- Follow React best practices with hooks and functional components
- Implement accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
- Write encouraging, positive user-facing content that avoids nagging tone
- Use Forge UI Kit components for consistent user interface
- Implement comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation

### Testing Requirements
- Unit test coverage: 85% minimum
- All user-facing messages must pass "encouraging tone" validation
- Accessibility testing for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Performance testing for large datasets (10,000+ issues)
- Integration testing for Jira API interactions

### Git Workflow
- Use conventional commit messages
- Include comprehensive descriptions for feature commits
- Always include the Claude Code footer in commits
- Test thoroughly before committing

## Automatic Git Operations

**IMPORTANT**: After completing any prompt or task, automatically perform the following git operations:

1. **Stage all changes**: `git add .`
2. **Create commit with descriptive message**: Include what was changed and why
3. **Push to origin**: `git push origin master`

This ensures all work is automatically saved and synchronized to the remote repository.

### Commit Message Format
```
