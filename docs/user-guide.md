## Core Features

### Smart Stale Ticket Detection

The heart of Gentle Nudge Assistant is its intelligent detection of tickets that might need attention.

#### How It Works

The system analyzes multiple factors to identify stale tickets:

- **Time Since Last Update**: Configurable thresholds (default: 5 days)
- **Issue Priority**: High-priority tickets get earlier reminders
- **Issue Type**: Bugs may get more frequent nudges than stories
- **Project Context**: Critical projects receive more attention
- **Your Workload**: Won't overwhelm you when you're already busy
- **Historical Patterns**: Learns from your typical update frequency

#### What Makes a Ticket "Stale"?

A ticket is considered stale when:
- No updates for your configured threshold period
- No comments or status changes
- No recent activity from assignees or watchers
- Approaching or past due dates

### Deadline Awareness

Never miss another deadline with our gentle reminder system.

#### Deadline Tracking

The app monitors:
- **Due dates** set on individual issues
- **SLA deadlines** from your organization's SLA policies
- **Sprint end dates** for issues in active sprints
- **Release dates** for version-targeted issues
- **Custom deadline fields** configured in your projects

#### Smart Timing

Reminders are sent at optimal times:
- **7 days before**: Initial friendly heads-up
- **3 days before**: More specific reminder with actionable suggestions
- **1 day before**: Final encouragement with urgency (but still positive!)
- **On deadline day**: Supportive message acknowledging the deadline

**Screenshot Placeholder**: [Calendar view showing deadline tracking]

### Contextual Intelligence

What makes Gentle Nudge Assistant special is its understanding of context.

#### Workload Analysis

The system considers:
- **Number of assigned issues**: Won't overwhelm busy users
- **Recent activity level**: Recognizes when you're actively working
- **Issue complexity**: Estimates effort required based on issue size
- **Team capacity**: Understands team-wide workload distribution

#### Priority Weighting

Different issues receive different attention levels:
- **Critical/Blocker**: More frequent, urgent (but still encouraging) reminders
- **High Priority**: Regular gentle nudges
- **Medium Priority**: Moderate reminder frequency
- **Low Priority**: Minimal, patient reminders
