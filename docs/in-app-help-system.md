## Help System Philosophy

### Core Principles

**Encouraging and Supportive**: Every help message should make users feel capable and confident
**Contextual and Relevant**: Help appears exactly when and where users need it
**Progressive and Non-Overwhelming**: Information is revealed gradually as users become more comfortable
**Actionable and Clear**: Every help message includes clear next steps or actions

### Tone Guidelines

**Encouraging Examples**:
- "You're doing great! Let's set up your preferences to make notifications even more helpful."
- "This setting will help ensure you get gentle reminders at just the right time!"
- "You've got this! These advanced features are here when you're ready to explore them."

**Avoid**:
- Technical jargon without explanation
- Overwhelming users with too many options at once
- Negative language or suggestions of failure
- Assumptions about user technical knowledge

## Onboarding Experience

### Welcome Tour (First Install)

#### Step 1: Welcome Screen
**Headline**: "Welcome to Gentle Nudge Assistant! üåü"
**Content**:
```
Hi there! We're thrilled you're here. 

Gentle Nudge Assistant transforms overwhelming Jira notifications into encouraging reminders that actually help you stay productive without the stress.

Ready to get started? This quick tour will have you set up in just 2 minutes!

[Let's Go!] [Skip Tour]
```

**Visual Elements**:
- Friendly mascot or illustration
- Progress indicator: "Step 1 of 4"
- Warm color scheme with soft gradients

#### Step 2: Smart Defaults
**Headline**: "We've Got You Covered! ‚ú®"
**Content**:
```
We've already set up some smart defaults based on what works best for most teams:

‚úÖ Gentle frequency (perfect for getting started)
‚úÖ 5-day stale threshold (gives you breathing room)
‚úÖ Encouraging tone (because you deserve kindness!)
‚úÖ Evening/weekend quiet hours (work-life balance matters!)

You can always customize these later, but these defaults are designed to be helpful right away.

[Sounds Perfect] [Let Me Customize]
```

#### Step 3: First Notification Preview
**Headline**: "Here's What to Expect üí™"
**Content**:
```
Your gentle nudges will look something like this:

[PREVIEW NOTIFICATION]
"Hey there! DEV-123 has been waiting patiently for an update. 
When you have a moment, it would appreciate some attention! ‚ú®"

Notice how different this feels from traditional notifications? 
That's the magic of gentle nudges!

## Contextual Help and Tooltips

You can always adjust this as your workload changes!
```

#### Stale Threshold
**Tooltip Text**:

‚è∞ When Should We Check In?

This sets how many days we wait before gently reminding you about inactive tickets.

‚Ä¢ 3 days: For fast-paced projects
‚Ä¢ 5 days: Sweet spot for most teams  
‚Ä¢ 7+ days: For strategic work with longer cycles

Remember: We're here to help, not hassle! 
```

```
üí¨ How Should We Talk to You?

‚Ä¢ Encouraging: Positive, supportive, motivating (default)

‚Ä¢ Check if project filters need adjusting

Would you like us to suggest some changes?

## Error Messages and Guidance

### Error Message Philosophy
**Encouraging**: Frame errors as learning opportunities
**Helpful**: Always provide clear resolution steps
**Empowering**: Give users confidence they can fix issues
**Human**: Use warm, conversational language

### Common Error Scenarios

#### Configuration Validation Errors
**Invalid Quiet Hours**:
```
‚è∞ Oops! Time Travel Isn't Quite Working Yet

It looks like your quiet hours end before they start! 
(We'd love to help you get more hours in the day, but physics won't let us üòâ)

Let's fix this:
‚Ä¢ Make sure end time comes after start time
‚Ä¢ Or use our "All Day Quiet" option for weekends

[Fix Automatically] [Let Me Adjust]
```

**Conflicting Settings**:
```
ü§î These Settings Are Having a Little Disagreement

Your notification frequency is set to "Moderate" but your daily limit is 1. 
That's like ordering a large coffee but asking for a tiny cup!

Here are some options:
‚Ä¢ Increase daily limit to 4-5 notifications  
‚Ä¢ Change frequency to "Minimal"
‚Ä¢ Let us suggest the perfect balance

[Auto-Balance] [I'll Decide]
```

#### Connection Issues
**Jira API Error**:
```
üîó Having Trouble Connecting to Jira

Don't worry - this happens sometimes! Here's what we can try:

1. Check your internet connection
2. Make sure you're logged into Jira
3. Try refreshing the page

Still not working? It might be a temporary Jira issue. 
These usually resolve themselves within a few minutes.

[Try Again] [Check Jira Status] [Contact Support]

**Insufficient Permissions**:
```
üîê We Need a Little More Access

Would you like us to:
‚Ä¢ Try saving again automatically
‚Ä¢ Show you what changed so you can review
