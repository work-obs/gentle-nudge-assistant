# Gentle Nudge Assistant - Jira Cloud Plugin

A friendly, encouraging Jira Cloud plugin built on Atlassian's Forge platform that provides context-aware reminders about stale tickets and approaching deadlines. Unlike traditional notification systems that can feel nagging or overwhelming, the Gentle Nudge Assistant emphasizes encouragement and positive reinforcement to help teams stay productive while maintaining morale.

## üåü Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Smart Stale Ticket Detection**: Identifies issues that haven't been updated within configurable timeframes
- **Deadline Awareness**: Monitors due dates and SLA deadlines with gentle pre-deadline reminders  
- **Contextual Intelligence**: Considers issue priority, project context, and user workload
- **Encouraging Tone**: Uses positive, supportive language in all communications
- **User-Controlled Preferences**: Individual users can customize notification frequency and timing

### Notification Types
1. **Gentle Stale Reminders**: "Your ticket [ISSUE-123] might benefit from a quick check-in ‚ú®"
2. **Friendly Deadline Notifications**: "Just a heads up - [ISSUE-456] is due tomorrow. You've got this! üí™"
3. **Motivational Progress Updates**: "Great progress on [PROJECT-X]! A few tickets could use your attention when you have time."
4. **Team Encouragement**: "The team is doing amazing work! Here are some tickets that might need a quick review."
5. **Achievement Recognition**: "Amazing work! You've been consistently updating your tickets. Keep it up! üéâ"

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The plugin is built with a modular TypeScript architecture consisting of four main components:

### 1. Notification Engine (`/src/notification-engine/`)
- **SchedulerService**: Handles timing and frequency of notifications with smart algorithms
- **ContentGenerator**: Creates encouraging, contextual reminder messages using templates
- **DeliveryManager**: Routes notifications to appropriate UI components with fallback support
- **ToneAnalyzer**: Ensures all messages maintain positive, encouraging tone

### 2. Issue Analytics (`/src/analytics/`)
- **JiraApiService**: Integration with Jira Cloud REST API v3 for issue and project data
- **Staleness Detection**: Analyzes last update times and activity patterns
- **Deadline Monitoring**: Tracks due dates and SLA timelines
- **User Workload Calculator**: Prevents overwhelming users with too many notifications

### 3. Configuration Management (`/src/config/`)
- **StorageService**: Forge storage integration for user preferences and tracking data
- **User Preferences**: Individual notification settings and timing
- **Team Settings**: Project-level configuration for reminder policies
- **GDPR Compliance**: Data export and deletion capabilities

### 4. Type System (`/src/types/`)
- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data models
- Strong typing for notification objects, user preferences, and API responses
- Configuration constants and validation rules

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20.x or 22.x LTS
- Atlassian Forge CLI (`@forge/cli`)
- Jira Cloud site with admin permissions

### Installation

1. **Clone and Setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd jira-plugin
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build the TypeScript**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Initialize Forge App**:
   ```bash
   forge create --template custom-ui
   # Follow prompts and copy the generated files
   ```

4. **Deploy to Development**:
   ```bash
   forge deploy
   forge install --upgrade
   ```

### Configuration

The system uses intelligent defaults but can be customized:

```typescript
import { GentleNudgeAssistant } from './src';

const nudgeAssistant = new GentleNudgeAssistant({
  enableToneValidation: true,
  minimumToneScore: 0.7,
  batchProcessingEnabled: true,
  adaptiveLearningEnabled: true,
  debugMode: false
});

await nudgeAssistant.initialize();
```

## üí° Usage Examples

### Basic Notification Creation
```typescript
// Create a stale reminder for an issue
const pipelineId = await nudgeAssistant.createNotification(
  'user-account-id',
  'PROJ-123',
  'stale-reminder',
  'medium'
);

// Process all stale issues for a user
await nudgeAssistant.processUserNotifications('user-account-id');
```

### Achievement Recognition
```typescript
// Celebrate when a user completes an issue
await nudgeAssistant.celebrateAchievement(
  'user-account-id',
  'issue-completed',
  {
    issueKey: 'PROJ-123',
    summary: 'Fixed critical bug',
    project: { key: 'PROJ', name: 'My Project' }
  }
);
```

### Analytics and Insights
```typescript
// Get notification effectiveness metrics
const analytics = await nudgeAssistant.getAnalytics('user-account-id', 30);
console.log('Delivery rate:', analytics.deliveryStatistics.successRate);
console.log('User engagement:', analytics.userAnalytics.engagementScore);
```

## üé® Message Examples
