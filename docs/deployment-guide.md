## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Installation and Setup Issues

#### App Installation Failures
**Symptom**: "Installation failed" error during marketplace installation
**Causes**:
- Insufficient Jira administrator permissions
- Network connectivity issues
- Temporary Atlassian service disruption
- Conflicting app dependencies

**Resolution Steps**:
1. Verify Jira administrator permissions
2. Check Atlassian status page for service issues
3. Clear browser cache and retry installation
4. Contact Atlassian support if persistent
5. Try installation from different browser/device

#### Configuration Import/Export Issues
**Symptom**: Settings not saving or import failing
**Diagnostic Steps**:
```bash
# Check configuration validation
curl -X POST /api/config/validate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @config.json

# Export current settings for backup
curl -X GET /api/config/export \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" > backup.json
```

**Common Solutions**:
- Validate JSON format for imported configurations
- Check for conflicting settings combinations
- Ensure user has appropriate permissions
- Use configuration templates for known-good settings

### Performance Issues

#### Slow Notification Delivery
**Symptoms**: Notifications arriving late or not at all
**Investigation Checklist**:
- Check Jira API rate limiting status
- Verify webhook endpoint availability
- Monitor system resource usage
- Review user workload analysis settings

**Optimization Steps**:
```yaml
performance_tuning:
  notification_batching:
    enabled: true
    batch_size: 50
    processing_interval: "5 minutes"
    
  cache_optimization:
    user_preferences: "1 hour TTL"
    issue_data: "15 minutes TTL"
    project_settings: "4 hours TTL"
    
  rate_limiting:
    respect_jira_limits: true
    backoff_strategy: "exponential"
    max_retries: 3
```

#### High Memory Usage
**Monitoring Commands**:
```bash
# Check application memory usage
forge logs --tail -f | grep "Memory"

# Monitor database connections
forge storage info

# Review notification queue depth
curl -X GET /api/admin/queue-status
```

### User Experience Issues

#### Notification Overload
**Symptoms**: Users reporting too many notifications, high dismissal rates
**Analysis Approach**:
1. Review user notification history and response patterns
2. Analyze workload sensitivity settings effectiveness
3. Check for configuration issues or conflicts
4. Survey users about optimal frequency preferences

**Remediation Strategy**:
```yaml
overload_mitigation:
  immediate_actions:
    - reduce_global_frequency: "From moderate to gentle"
    - increase_stale_thresholds: "Add 2-3 days buffer"
    - enable_workload_sensitivity: "For all users"
    
  medium_term_adjustments:
    - user_education: "Optimal settings workshops"
    - template_optimization: "Role-based configurations"
    - feedback_integration: "User preference learning"
    
  long_term_improvements:
    - ai_optimization: "Machine learning for timing"
    - predictive_analytics: "Anticipate user needs"
    - advanced_personalization: "Individual behavior modeling"
```

#### Low User Engagement
**Symptoms**: Low response rates, minimal feature adoption
**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Insufficient user training and onboarding
- Poor initial configuration leading to irrelevant notifications
- Lack of clear value demonstration
- Competing priorities and change resistance

**Engagement Strategy**:
```yaml
engagement_improvement:
  awareness_campaign:
    - success_story_sharing: "Highlight productivity wins"
    - feature_spotlights: "Monthly feature education"
    - peer_advocacy: "Champion program expansion"
    
  configuration_optimization:
    - personalized_setup_sessions: "1-on-1 configuration help"
    - team_specific_templates: "Relevant default settings"
    - gradual_feature_introduction: "Progressive disclosure"
