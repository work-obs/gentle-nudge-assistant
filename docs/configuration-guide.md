**Screenshot Placeholder**: [Import/export interface with file upload and preview]

## Troubleshooting Configuration

### Common Configuration Issues

#### Problem: Not Receiving Notifications

**Diagnostic Steps**:
1. Check notification frequency settings
2. Verify project filters include your assigned projects
3. Ensure you're not in an extended quiet hours period
4. Check if workload analysis is preventing notifications
5. Verify Jira permissions allow app access

**Solution Matrix**:
```yaml
troubleshooting:
  no_notifications:
    checks:
      - setting: "notification_frequency"
        expected: "not set to 'disabled'"
      - setting: "quiet_hours"
        check: "current time outside quiet period"
      - setting: "project_filters"
        check: "includes user's assigned projects"
      - permission: "jira_work_read"
        required: true
    
    quick_fixes:
      - "Reset to default settings"
      - "Run notification test"
      - "Check Jira permissions"
```

#### Problem: Too Many Notifications

**Adjustment Strategy**:
1. Reduce notification frequency to "gentle" or "minimal"
2. Increase stale ticket threshold
3. Enable workload sensitivity
4. Add project or issue type filters
5. Extend quiet hours

**Screenshot Placeholder**: [Troubleshooting checklist interface]

#### Problem: Wrong Tone/Language

**Customization Options**:
1. Switch communication tone setting
2. Adjust emoji frequency
3. Create custom message templates
4. Check localization settings

### Configuration Validation

The app includes built-in validation to prevent configuration issues:

```yaml
validation_rules:
  stale_threshold:
    min: 1
    max: 30
    warning_if: "> 14"           # Warn if threshold seems too high
  
  notification_limits:
    max_daily: 10                # Hard limit to prevent spam
    recommend_max: 5             # Recommended maximum
  
  quiet_hours:
    minimum_duration: 4          # At least 4 hours of quiet time
    maximum_duration: 20         # At most 20 hours (prevent all-day quiet)
  
  consistency_checks:
    - "deadline_warnings must be in descending order"
    - "excluded_projects cannot include all assigned projects"
    - "quiet_hours cannot cover entire work day"
```
